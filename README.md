An Instagram grid template, for multi-part image compositions
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ingrid is a template providing you with an easy way to export a tiling set of images which can be uploaded to Instagram, based on a 15pt grid. Design your layout at 1× (a series of tiling 375 × 375pt images), and export higher resolution slices (4× jpeg by default; 1500 × 1500px) for upload to Instagram.


Why 375pt?
----------

375pt is the native display width of the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, 8, X, and XS—which accounts for a large number of devices browsing Instagram within the native app. It’s a convenient starting point, which handily corresponds to a nice 15pt display grid. It also means your grid of photos will subtly align with Instagram’s own UI elements, when viewed on corresponding devices.
